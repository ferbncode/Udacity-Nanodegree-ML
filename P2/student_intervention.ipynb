    "**Answer: **<br/>\n",
    "1.**SVMs**:- SVMs tend to be slow with a large training data and are bad with a lot of noise in the data. But considering that the no of training examples are 300 (which are comparatively less), we can use a svm. If the data is linearly seperable, a linear kernel on the svm will do very well.<br/> General explanation and pros and cons of SVMs are:-\n",
    "+ SVMs are used for image clssification(Why?). It is so because they present a large margin classifier. Thus, a zebra will be identified as zebra and a horse would not be identified as a zebra. This is so because the confidence of SVMs are greater since they have a decision boundary that has a large margin between the two classes. \n",
    "+ It works really well with clear margin of separation\n",
    "+ It is effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "+ It is effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "+ It uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient. Thus it captures few important examples well.\n",
    "+ SVM doesn’t directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>Some Industry applications and why svm can be suitable for the problem at hand:-\n",
    "+ SVMs are helpful in text and hypertext categorization as their application can significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive settings. Thus from this point, one can derive that their is less need of training data for SVMs. Since our example uses just 300 examples, an SVM would be a robust classifier.\n",
    "+ Hand-Written digit recognization is precisely done using svms. When it comes to the real world, there are many ways in which people draw digits. Now, svms are large-margin classifiers, using only some very important vectors for drawing margin. Thus, they would capture the most important examples even with a small amount of data. Thus, intuituvely they are good for our problem as we can capture most important distinctions with the use of SVMs.\n",
    "+ Image Classification. They present a good decision boundary and thus a clear confident classifier\n",
    "+ Protein sequences are assigned to functional families using SVMs. There are 2 million proteins in just our body. Now, their classification problem was solved using SVMs. It was so because a reasonably small dataset for training could present a good model. Plus the no of features was comparatively more. Thus an svm would do well for our dataset too as no of features are 48 and training examples are 300.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.**Instance Based Methods like KNN**:- Instance based methods like KNN can also do well in fitting a dataset of less size as finding the nearest few neighbours corresponding to the query may be found and the corresponding label with the maximum vote can be returned.<br/>\n",
    "General Applications of and explainations about KNN are:-\n",
    "+ Works well provided there is lots of data and the distance function is good. Thus we need to have a data(we can give it a try with 300 examples)\n",
    "+ It takes more time during test time or query time.\n",
    "+ finding a reasonable distance function might take effort.(a lot of)\n",
    "+ Storage of data is a big problem with large datasets in KNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>Some of its industry applications and why it can be suitable for the problem at hand:\n",
    "+ K Nearest Neighbours is sometimes used in Auto-summarization problems. The graph contains each sentence as a node and links between sentences according to some distance metric. Then one can link each sentence to its k-nearest neighbors and one can even use k=#total_nodes.\n",
    "However, this points out that we have to get a reasonably large amount of data. However, lets give it a try for our dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ A drawback of the basic \"majority voting\" classification occurs when the class distribution is skewed. That is, examples of a more frequent class tend to dominate the prediction of the new example, because they tend to be common among the k nearest neighbors due to their large number. However our class is skewed. So, it might not be a suitable one. (But lets give it a try however :) )\n",
    "\n",
    "3.**Decision Trees**:- Though the no of features are more, a less depth decision tree can be used to determine the outcome of the classification problem and thus, prevent overfitting. Moreover, using a decision tree is more explanatory than using Neural Nets or logistic regression classification technique.\n",
    "+ The Decision Trees are great for explanation. It is like asking questions and then moving with the best feature. \n",
    "+ It is like a greedy algorithm, splitting with the best current feature to split (using information gain). \n",
    "+ Among the major decision tree disadvantages are its complexity. Decision trees are easy to use compared to other decision-making models, but preparing decision trees, especially large ones with many branches, are complex and time-consuming affairs.\n",
    "+ If the max_depth is not set properly, then the model may overfit.\n",
    "+ Have value even with little hard data. Important insights can be generated based on experts describing a situation (its alternatives, probabilities, and costs) and their preferences for outcomes.\n",
    "+ Allow the addition of new possible scenarios.\n",
    "+ Nonlinear relationships between parameters do not affect tree performance.\n",
    "+ Cons:- For data including categorical variables with different number of levels, information gain in decision trees are biased in favor of those attributes with more levels.\n",
    "+ Calculations can get very complex particularly if many values are uncertain and/or if many outcomes are linked.\n",

    "<br/>Some of its industry applications and why it can be suitable for the problem at hand:\n",
    "+ As discussed in the pros and cons section, decision trees allow for addition of new possible scenarios easily. \n",
    "+ Moreover, in our case, one feature might be more important than other features. Decision Trees capture feature importance( there are 48 features). Thus decision tree may perform implicit feature selection.(out of our 48 features).\n",

    "+ Object recognition: Tree based classification has been used recently for recognizing three dimensional objects and for high level vision\n",
    "+ Decision trees have been used for the detection of physical particles. \n",
    "+ Financial Analysis: They have been used for determining attractiveness of user in finance. \n",
    "+ Thus, the decision trees can capture more important features as in problems like financial analysis or 3d object recongnization, some major properties have to be captured for an approximate good classification."

    "**Answer: **Some points to be considered<br/>\n",
    "**1. Maximum Dataset size: 300 and No of features: 48**<br/>\n",
    "+ SVM:- Since we dont have much data, it is suitable to select an SVM (an SVM doesnot do well with large and noisy data). Plus since the no of features is 48, we do prevent overfitting on the data, since the F1 score shows this (on the train set). We can modify the svm by choosing a suitable kernel and suitable C and lambda.(presently linear kernel and default params are used).\n",
    "+ Decision Tree:- The decision tree (without modifying the max_depth param) overfits the training data and is not suitable(F1 score of 1.000). However, modification of max_depth and other hyperparameters may improve the F1 score over the test set. For eg., setting max_depth to 5, increases final test F1 score (300 examples) to 0.8392.\n",
    "+ KNN:- KNN is showing comparatively good F1 score comparatively but its improvement is not quite flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Training and Test time**<br/>\n",
    "+ SVM:- If training and test time are a concern, then the training time of svm is quite higher than the decision tree and the KNN.\n",
    "+ DecisionTree:- In comparision to the other classifiers, the DecisionTree Classifier offers less train and test times.\n",
    "+ KNN: - Offers less train time but high test time(comparative to other models)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Importance of features and the Complexity of the model**<br/>\n",
    "+ SVM:- The complexity of the SVM being increased (choosing a correct kernel) can improve the F1 score. For example, the final test F1 score increases to arount 0.84 when rbf kernel is used. \n",
    "+ Decision Tree: Some features capture more information than others. In this case, we have 48 features which are quite many. Thus, using a proper max_depth for a decision tree might be useful and may improve our evaluation metric.\n",
    "+ KNN: Treats all features equally and thus determines the class. Thus, since feature importance pays a major role, KNN might not be suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus if training and test times are a concern, then Decision trees must be taken and then optimized to train a classifier (a good f1 score  can be obtained).\n",
    "If not, an SVM with a proper kernel can be used to train a good accuracy classifier.\n",
    "Thus considering points of complexity, cost, limited resources and performance, a DecisionTree Classifier is suitable.\n",
    "However, if train and test times are not too much of a concern, a SVM with a proper kernel can be used.\n",

It is so because they preserve a decision boundary that is quite far from both positive and negative examples. **An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall on.** <br/>\n",

Also, the SVM presents a large margin classifier. Thus the confidence with which an SVM works is higher in comparision to classifiers. Also, we have a small and noise-free(possibly) data and thus, an svm is suitable. Moreover, a suitable kernel can improve accuracy. <br/>\n",

The gamma parameters can be seen as the inverse of the radius of influence of samples selected by the model as support vectors.\n",

A low C makes the decision surface smooth, while a high C aims at classifying all training examples correctly by giving the model freedom to select more samples as support vectors.\n",
